## Project Overview
This project is a multiplayer game. The game was orignally going to be a tile based dungeon crawler but that was a little too much to implement for me so now it is more of a tron esque game with trailes that players can leave that deal damage to anyone who touch them.

The game will be hosted so hopefully people could play remotley but it might be out of reach for me to do that so I might stick to a local computer or local network but the goal is for it be able to be played multiplayer remotley.

I choose to make a multiplayer game because games that are multiplayer are more fun than those that are single player. I feel that a single player game is you versus the world or environment which limits the player to interacting with a world that the developer created which developers are not perfect or the greatest stratagiests so it can become lacking in challenge or lacking in variety as it is only from one person. Multiplayer games can have the same issues but they can also help overcome those challenges because nothing is harder to beat than another mind.
