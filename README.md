## Project Overview
This project is a multiplayer game. The game will be a tile based adventure/dungeon game where you go from level to level with another player. The players will have access to ranged and melee weapons. It has projectiles and will be real time. 

The game will be hosted so hopefully people could play remotley but it might be out of reach for me to do that so I might stick to a local computer or local network but the goal is for it be able to be played multiplayer remotley.

I choose to make a multiplayer game because I am curious if I can make one. I have thought about making one before but was always unsure how to get it to work with multiple people and I am still a little unsure of how to do it but it will be a good learning expeirence for me.
